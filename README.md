# Fake News Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using machine learning techniques. The primary components of the project include:

- Text data preprocessing using `TfidfVectorizer` from scikit-learn.
- Implementation of machine learning models, specifically Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy and classification report.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Other relevant libraries

## Features

- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Convert text data into TF-IDF features for machine learning.
- **Logistic Regression:** Utilize logistic regression for binary classification of news articles.
- **Decision Tree Classifier:** Implement a decision tree classifier for comparison.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git



Run the fake news detection script:

bash

    python fake_news_detection.py
